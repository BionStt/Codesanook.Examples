When validation start
- form submit
- field is dirty


MVC no any custom validations
Spreedly event enter

Benefit of jQuery validator
    - We can attach rules from JavaScript code e.g. https://jqueryvalidation.org/rules/#example:-adds-minlength:-2-to-an-element-which-is-already-required
    - Later we can use it with ASP.NET MVC attributes 
    - Moving an error message to MVC validation attribute and everything should work.
    - It is still supported by ASP.NET MVC Core 3 https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/models/validation?view=aspnetcore-3.0
